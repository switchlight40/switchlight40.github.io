        <p>This site Has not logged your data (Yet)</p>
        <p>What do we mean by this...</p>
        <p>So ideally when you open this website it will record that you have seen this and will send a signal to my computer<br />This will eventually go through a microcontroller and dispense a dog treat for my dog (after other criteria has been met)</p>
        <p>This system is currently offline :/</p>
        <p>I will also somehow make a customised dog treat card or something idk</p>
        <p>Graphics will come later this is still a proof of concept</p>
        <p>also dont check the html please i am not a web developer lol</p>
